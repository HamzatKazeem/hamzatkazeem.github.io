			<h2>Biography:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li class="bold">Education</li>
			
			I have Bachelors degree in Mathematical Science(Computer Major).<br>
			I have recently completed a Master`s degree in Big Data Analytics. During my postgraduate studies, I had a 6 months work placement where I began to learn about Web Development.<br> I have recognised this as my interest and continue to look for opportunity to enhance my skill.<br> I was opportuned to work on a Front-end project that can be viewed at https://checkcert.highfieldqualifications.com. It is important to say a colleague set-up the project while I only developed the <em class="bold">HTML and CSS part(Bootstrap 4)</em>. I have also used <em class="bold">Python Programming</em> to develop Sentiment Analyis application. The Github page: <a href="https://github.com/HamzatKazeem/Work_Placement_Report">Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HamzatKazeem/Work_Placement_Report/blob/Workplacement_report/PlacementReport5.ipynb">Ouput</a>

			<li class="bold">Previuos Work Experience</li>
			I have previously worked as Business Analyst intefacing between Software Developers and Web Application End-users, elicitating requirements,discuss and effect changes while ensuring new moduless were properly integrated without productivity lulls.

			<li class="bold">Expectation:</li>
			I am hoping to get on to the program to build my programming skills to a level of developing commercial applications. I have continue to receive job offer as a Web Developer on Linkedln but I want to gather more requisite skills(Javascript and Web API) require to independently develop an application . I therefore wish to be considered for the training.
